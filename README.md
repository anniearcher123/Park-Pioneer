## General info
This project takes information from the NPS.gov API and uses it to make planning your National Park trip more convenient. You can select a national park and view the amenities, campgrounds, and activities for that park. You can also add the activities that you want to do to your customizable calendar, as well as other custom events. This project was created by Annie Archer, Joseph George, and Taylor Mathis as our final Capstone Project for the Digital Crafts Part-Time Cohort.
