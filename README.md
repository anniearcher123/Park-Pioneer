## General Info
Park Pioneer is a website built for National Park explorers who want to plan their trips ahead of time in order to fully enjoy their experience in nature. This website provides the user with an easy to navigate source of information for whatever National Park that they choose. The user will be able to choose a national park and view the weather, amenities, campground information, and activities for their park. The user can then add any events or activities to a fully customizable calendar, where you can make edits to the date and time of events if needed.
